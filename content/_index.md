# About me :star2:
I love solving scientific problems, and I believe there is always a beautiful solution for everything. Even though I have a strong background in biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and data analysis for biological research, I am always fascinated by multidisciplinary research, which emerged as an indispensable part of science. Life is more than just what we do in our area. Opening our vision to other fields will help us explore our true potential and produce innovative ideas.
